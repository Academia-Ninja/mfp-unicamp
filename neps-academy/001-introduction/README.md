# Introduction
## Hardware
Hardware is every physical part of a computer. It can be a monitor, a keyboard, pieces that go inside a computer and so on.

### Von Neumann's Architecture
- This architecture is separated in six parts: 
    1. Central Processing Unit (CPU): it is where data processing takes place and consists of a Control Unit (CU) and a Logic and Arithmetic Unit (ULA) and is always communicating with the computer memory;
    2. Arithmetic Logic Unit: Responsible for performing mathematical and logical operations
    3. Control Unit: access, decode and execute the instructions of a program stored in memory;
    4. Memory
        
        - RAM (Random Access Memory): a volatile memory (every time the computer is turned off, it will lose all the stored data);
        - ROM (Read-Only Memory): a memory where only reading information is possible;
        - Hard drives have as their primary function storing large amounts of data. It is on the hard drive that photos, videos, documents and games are stored. Today it is considered slow because it uses a mechanical needle to access the data.
        - SSDs have the same function as a hard drive, but they use newer technology and have no mechanical parts to access the data, for this reason, they are faster.
    5. Input Device: a device that provides any information to the computer.
    6. Output Device: a device used to transmit information from the computer to the user.
