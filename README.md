# MFP Unicamp

Women's Programming Marathon (MFP) by UNICAMP emerged as an initiative to expand the participation of women and non-binary people with feminine alignment or neutral in the area of computing, especially in higher education (extract from the MFP Unicamp notice).

This repository is a study preparation for the event and future competitive programming events, based in MFP Study Guide.
